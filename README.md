GimliDS is a C64 Emulator for the DS/DSi and is copyright (c) 2025 Dave Bernazzani (wavemotion-dave)

As GimliDS is a port of the Frodo emulator for the DS/DSi/XL/LL handhelds,
any copying or distribution of this emulator, its source code and associated
readme files, with or without modification, are permitted per the original 
Frodo emulator license shown below.  Hugest thanks to Christian Bauer for his
efforts to provide a clean open-source emulation base for the C64.

Numerous hacks and 'unsafe' optimizations have been performed on the original 
Frodo emulator codebase to get it running on the small handheld system. You 
are strongly encouraged to seek out the official Frodo sources if you're at
all interested in this emulator code.

The GimliDS emulator is offered as-is, without any warranty. Please see readme.md
